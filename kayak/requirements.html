<h1>Kayak Project Requirements</h1>
<p>The goal is to create a simple web application that displays information about various
airlines.</p>
.
<h2>General Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>The application must at least match the provided mockups. There is freedom to experiment beyond that, all specifications provided must be followed.</li>
<li>The application must behave as a single page application (the document cannot be reloaded for any of the behavior).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>The page must behave responsively to accommodate smaller window widths so that the tiles in each row always fit in the window without being cut off. A mockup is provided showing an example of the grid within a smaller window.</li>
<li>Each Airline tile should display the airline name and logo. On hover, more information about the airline should be displayed (Alliance name, phone number, & website). The Alaska Airlines & Ukraine International Airlines tiles in the mocks illustrate the expected display on hover.</li>
<li>The Alliance filter above the tiles should filter the list of Airlines to only show Airlines matching the enabled filters if any are selected. If none are selected, the entire list should be shown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open-source libraries (e.g. Angular, React, jQuery, etc.).</li>
<li>CSS preprocessors (e.g., LESS, SASS, etc.)</li>
<li>The alliance field in the JSON objects returned from the API should be used or the Alliance filter shown in the mockups. The alliance codes map to the following values:
ST = “Sky Team”
OW = “Oneworld”
SA = “Star Alliance”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mockups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full size mockups with spacing & styling </li>
<li>An SVG is provided for the logo.</li>
<li>1 full size mock of the app at a normal desktop screen width and</li>
<li>1 example mock of the app at a smaller screen width to demonstrate responsiveness.</li>
<li>There are 2 spec images with annotations on top of the original mocks to provide information on spacing, color, font-size, etc.</li>
<li>For all tiles, both by default and on hover, assume the logo & text are always vertically and horizontally centered within the tile. Also, the dimensions of each tile should not change.</li>
</ul>
